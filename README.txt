== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do we need to add Festival Animations ourselves? =

Yes, ofcourse. Obviously, you won't like a plugin uploading some images automatically to your database. So, the images are your matter. Still, if you are in search of good images, be sure you drop us an email. Or you may simply find Festival's GIF image on Google Images!

= Do we need to set those festivals every year? =

Yeah, you have to. Or, you may schedule them easily by naming FestGreets and setting up dates. For Eg. "<b>Christmas 2017</b>,<b>Christmas 2018</b>, and so on."
